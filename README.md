## 🧠 About Me

I’m a disciplined learner building my life from zero.

Currently focused on mastering Python and building real-world projects that solve practical problems.  
I believe in consistency, long-term thinking, and creating systems instead of chasing shortcuts.

My goal is simple:  
Build skills → Build products → Build freedom.
